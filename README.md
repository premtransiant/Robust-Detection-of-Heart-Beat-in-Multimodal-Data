# Robust-Detection-of-Heart-Beat-in-Multimodal-Data
Matlab Code for used for : the Robust Detection of Heart Beat in Multimodal Data.
The first part is for CREATING DATABASE
The second part is for NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING AND TESTING in have  created a feed forward backprop network with 3 hidden layer of 12,20 &8 resp neuron.
The Physionet ATM Waveform Database data are used by making use of all relevant information. Data for this project are 1-minute (or occasionally shorter) excerpts (“records”) of longer multi-parameter recordings of human adults, including patients with a wide range of problems as well as healthy volunteers. Each record contains four to eight signals; the ﬁrst is an ECG signal in each case, but the others are a variety of simultaneously recorded physiologic signals that may be useful for robust beat detection. We took 10 training records, for evaluation of project
